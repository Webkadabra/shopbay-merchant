 * A subscription has moved from the active status to the past due status. 
 * This occurs when a subscriptionâ€™s initial transaction is declined.
 * 
 * Braintree Note:
 * If a payment for a subscription fails, the subscription status will change to Past Due. 
 * You can manually retry the charge, or you can set up logic in the Control Panel to automatically retry a declined or failed charge at specific intervals. 
 * Additionally, a past due subscription will be automatically retried if the payment method associated with the subscription 
 * is updated and you either have proration enabled or are manually passing the prorate charge option. 
 * If the retried transaction is successful and the subscription has not passed its last billing date, the status will change to Active.
